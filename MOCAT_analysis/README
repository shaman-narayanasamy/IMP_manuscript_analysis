There are three folders representing three different types of analysis carried
out using MOCAT, separated into three folders accordingly.
1. MG only analysis - MG folder
2. MT only analysis - MT folder
3. MG and MT analysis - Combined folder

Inside each folder, one would find subdirectories of each of the environment
types, where each of them contain further subdirectories with representing the
relevant samples from those different environments:
1. biogas_plant  
2. human_fecal  
   Subdirectories - X310763260, X311245214, X316192082, X316701492, X317690558
3. simulated_data  
4. wastewater_sludge
   Subdirectories - A02, D32, D36, D49

Inside each of the analysis subdirectories, one will find the script "runALL.sh"
which the analyses.
