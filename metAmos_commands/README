The sample names used in the paper are named differently within the file
system:

1.  The simulated mock (SM) community dataset is named either "simDat" or "simulated_data".
2.  The human fecal (HF) community dataset is named X310763260.
3.  The wastewater (WW) sludge community dataset is named A02.

There are a total of six launcher scripts. Precisely, two (2) launcher scripts for each sample:

1. Running metAmos on default mode (SOAPdenovo assembler)
2. Running metAmos on using IDBA-UD assembler

For the IDBA-UD based assemblies, libraries require concatenation prior to
using them as input for the pipeline (commands within script).
