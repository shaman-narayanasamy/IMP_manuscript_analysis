The sample names used in the paper are named differently within the file
system:

1. The simulated mock (SM) community dataset
2. The human fecal (HF1-5) community datasets
3. The wastewater (WW1-4) sludge community datasets
4. The production scale anaerobic biogas (BG) reactor dataset

Two (2) commands are launched for each dataset

1. Running IMP on default mode (IDBA-UD assembler)
2. Running IMP using MEGAHIT assembler

There are two different configuration files available within the "conf"
directory:

1. With the human genome derived sequence filtering, used for SM and HF1-5
2. Without the human genome derived sequence filtering, used for WW1-4 and BG
