The sample names used in the paper are named differently within the file
system:

1.  The simulated mock (SM) community dataset is named either "simDat" or "simulated_data".
2.  The human fecal (HF) community dataset is named X310763260.
3.  The wastewater (WW) sludge community dataset is named A02.

There are a total of six launcher scripts. Precisely, two (2) launcher scripts for each sample:

1. Running IMP on default mode (IDBA-UD assembler)
2. Running IMP using MEGAHIT assembler

There are two different configuration files available within the "conf"
directory:

1. With the human genome derived sequence filtering, used for SM and HF.
1. Without the human genome derived sequence filtering, used for WW
